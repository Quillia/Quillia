- 👋 Hi, I’m @Quillia
- 👀 I’m interested in web and software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Nucamp, but I really only
needed javascript (because I already know HTML and CSS). I'm really just out of practice. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing yet. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Via email.
